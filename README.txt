             Compact object simulations on the sphere
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION 
     This package provides functionality to support the simulation on
     the sphere of compact objects embedded in a stochastic background
     process of specified power spectrum. More specifically, compact
     objects with an arbitrary template function may be embedded in
     background Gaussian cosmic microwave background radiation. This
     is the primary astrophysical application that motivates the
     construction of the library. Support is provided to convolve with
     beam functions and to add additional white noise.
